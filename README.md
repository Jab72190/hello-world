# hello-world
First ever coding/github project!
A new resident of Colorado as of January 2017. Born and raised outside of Philly. Have been in IT recruiting since college. Hoping to learn how to code and other IT skills for a future career path in IT! Love the outdoors, especially snowboarding and hiking. Needless to say, Colorado has been great so far :).
